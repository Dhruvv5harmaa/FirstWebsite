    Hii this page is under construction by me. 
    As I get time I'll update things in here !

    Some more facts about me. 
    I can solve rubix cube in less than a minute. 

    I can solve mirror cube blindfolded.(without cheating)

    I love photography. 

    I want to update my thoughts as well , but it would be not so good if I keep editing my 
    website for each single thought, so I have decided to provide my link to my blog  ,
    incase you want to read my thoughts. 

    I really loving to share my recent thoughts and learnings.
